    "    For example X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. First row can be selected as X[0] \n",

    "\"\"\"We will write a Python program to get the multiplication of two input matrices and print the result in output. \n",
    "   This Python program specifies how to multiply two matrices, having some certain values.\n",
    "   \n",

    "   \n",
    "   In the multiplication of two matrices, the row elements of the first matrix are multiplied to the column \n",
    "   elements of the second matrix.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: Suppose we have given following two A and B matrices:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A = [[5, 4, 3]  \n",
    "         [2, 4, 6]  \n",
    "         [4, 7, 9]]  \n",

    "                  [2, 7, 5]]  \n",
    "                  \n",
    "                  \n",
    "C would be the addition of above given two matrices, i.e., C = A+B, and therefore C should be:\n",

    "        \n",
    "    As we can see that the resulting matrix C, which is also known as matrix product, has the same number \n",
    "    of rows as the first matrix (A matrix) and the same number of columns as the second matrix (B matrix). \n",
    "    We also know this type of multiplication of matrices as dot product of matrices.   \n",
